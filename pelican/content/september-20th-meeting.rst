Our regular location was booked for this month's meeting, so at the last
minute we tried to find a web conference solution.  Our first choice did
not work well, and we moved over to another service.  I apologize  to
anyone who tried to join the meeting and got lost in the shuffle. 
Thanks to Jeff and Jay for going thru the pains of figuring out the
details and getting mics working well.  We will find a good solution
before next month's meeting.  We are hoping to give more people the
opportunity to be involved and also have more guest presenters.

In spite of the difficulty, Jeff persisted with an introduction to
testing in Python.  He talked mainly about `Python
Koans <http://bitbucket.org/gregmalcolm/python_koans/wiki/Home>`__, by
Greg Malcom. From the website:

    Python Koans is an interactive tutorial for learning Python by
    making tests pass.

    Most tests are 'fixed' by filling the missing parts of assert
    functions. Eg:

    ::

        self.assertEqual(__, 1+2)

    which can be fixed by replacing the \_\_ part with the appropriate
    code:

    ::

        self.assertEqual(3, 1+2)

    Occasionally you will encounter some failing tests that are already
    filled out. In these cases you will need to finish implementing some
    code to progress. For example, there is an exercise for writing some
    code that will tell you if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or
    scalene.

    As well as being a great way to learn some Python, it is also a good
    way to get a taste of `Test Driven Development
    (TDD) <http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html>`__.

Jeff has been working on a couple of sections a day.  (Joe - I thought
that you might like this style of learning - I am going to try it
myself.) There are versions for Python 2.6 and 3.1.
