Well now, that was quite a meeting. We ended up not talking about any of
the announced subjects so it was a very good
meeting. \ `Eli <http://eli.criffield.net/>`__ made an appearance
tonight and for a sysadmin who doesn't "program", Eli has produced some
pretty interesting python
projects. \ `sipie <http://freshmeat.net/projects/sipie/>`__, Pronounced
SY PIE, like "sirius python", sipie is a command line player for Sirius
online Internet streaming

We also talked about using private certs and CA's, the different python
based packages and use them with the \ `twisted
framework <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/>`__. Eli hammered out the
details and did something with twisted that not many knew was possible.
Thanks for sharing — Very Cool.

As with previous meetings, kudos to Jay and Reboot The User for
graciously donating the space for the gathering. The new executive
conference room is nearing completion — we will be stylin' then. Also,
props to Todd for covering the pizza guy before I got there. Pizza and
Pop sponsored by DM&T.

And finally, thanks to O'Reilly (Marsee) for the great door prize. Eli
won the door prize, "Programming Python" by Mark Lutz.
