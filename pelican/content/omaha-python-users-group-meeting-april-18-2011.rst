Tonight's meeting:

Steve talked about the book he just read, "`Start Small, Stay
Small <http://www.amazon.com/Start-Small-Stay-Developers-Launching/dp/0615373968/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1303171806&sr=8-1>`__".
 The premise is fast is good.   Jeff talked about the book he was
reading, "Programming Collective Intelligence".  Conversations then
turned to SQL, and good resources.   It was pointed out there are a
number of really good references on the web and that it is probably best
to just do it, keeping in mind that every table needs a primary key and
to never depend on the user to give you information that you would use
as part of the primary key without checking.

Jeff was motivated by the PyCon video, "`Python and Robots: Teaching
programming in High School <http://pycon.blip.tv/file/4880794/>`__".  He
actually went out and got an S2 and Fluke board and is now actively
teaching his kids how to program robots in Python.

More talk about the results from the survey were discussed.  Focusing on
"events" and moving away from traditional "user group" seemed to be
popular and something we want to move forward and try.

 

Next "Event" is in May -- See you then.
