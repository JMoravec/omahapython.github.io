Jeff will be presenting the opening round of our **todo.txt respin with
python** for the "New to Python or Programming" section.  The goals for
the night's section will be:

-   Defining the problem
-   Initial architecture of the solution
-   Building a corner-stone class
-   Writing our first tests (not necessarily in that order <g>)

To get ready for the fun, bring a laptop or device with:

-   python 2.x installed
-   `virtualenv  <%20http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`__
-   `py.test <http://pytest.org/latest/>`__ (demo
   `here <http://pyvideo.org/video/645/pytest-rapid-and-simple-testing-with-python>`__)
-   a favorite editor
-   a smile

We don't have an advanced level talk set in stone yet, so if you are
yearning to talk about a project you are working on, something in the
standard or 3rd party libs that saved your bacon or just made you say
"Cool." We'd love to have you tell us about it. No experience required.

**Door Prize**: O'Reilly Python Book.

Wednesday, March 21st at 7pm.  See the \ `where and
when <http://www.omahapython.org/blog/where-and-when>`__ page for
directions.

In the future Jeff plans on doing a session on supporting Python 2 and 3
just like `CherryPy
does <http://pyvideo.org/video/689/how-cherrypy-supports-python-2-and-3>`__.
  And since he plans on using
`Tox <http://pyvideo.org/video/435/pycon-2011--supporting-all-versions-of-python-all>`__\ which
was written by Holger Krekel (the same guy who develops py.test) we
figured now would be a good time for us to tryout py.test.
