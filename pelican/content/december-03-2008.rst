Because of a last-minute scheduling conflict, instead of meeting at `Rosken's Hall <http://www.unomaha.edu/pages/rh.html>`__, Room 402 on UNO's campus, We met in the 4th floor lounge in Rosken's Hall. Outside of missing a projector, the lounge was outfitted with plenty of power and wired/wireless connections.
