The meeting began with a roundup of several books and online courses for
**learning Python**:

-  `Dive into Python <http://diveintopython.org/>`__ and `Dive into
   Python 3 <http://diveintopython3.org/>`__\ |Learning Python|
-  `A Byte of Python <http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python>`__ - 2.x
   and 3.0
-  `How to Think Like a Computer
   Scientist <http://openbookproject.net//thinkCSpy/index.html>`__
-  `Snake Wrangling for
   Kids <http://www.briggs.net.nz/log/writing/snake-wrangling-for-kids/>`__
-  `MIT Video
   Lectures <http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2008/>`__
-  `Crunchy <http://code.google.com/p/crunchy/>`__- interactive Python
   tutorials served thru a web browser

Jeff led a twenty minute discussion of interesting items in **Python
2.7**, including

-  Ordered Dictionary type
-  Faster io module
-  deprecation warnings disabled by default

We then had a brief introduction to **Testing in Python** and Jeff
agreed to lead further discussion at the September meeting.

-  `Unittest <http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html>`__- unit
   testing framework that ships with Python
-  `Nose <http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/>`__, a unittest-based
   testing framework for Python that makes writing and running tests
   easier
-  `doctests <http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html>`__
-  Two main reasons for testing were "Writing your code with testing in
   mind makes for better code" (or something like that), and I forget
   the other one...
-  `Selenium <http://seleniumhq.org/>`__- a suite of tools to automate
   web app testing across many platforms.Â  (not Python specific, but
   really cool)

The remainder of the meeting moved into some sys admin topics, where
`jails <http://www.freebsddiary.org/jail-6.php>`__,
`zfs <http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Community+Group+zfs/WebHome>`__,
and `btrfs <http://oss.oracle.com/projects/btrfs/>`__ were touted.

The **August** meeting may be at a different location, so check before
