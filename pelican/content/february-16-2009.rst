This month we met at the Fox and Hound, however, the noise levels at
times were disruptive. In general it was decent meeting area but too
loud thanks to juke box which they had no ability to control sound
levels in the meeting room. The sound control worked the entire side of
the building. Oh well, next meeting â€” something new!
