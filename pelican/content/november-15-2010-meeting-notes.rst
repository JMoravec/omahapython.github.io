We continued our focus on testing tonight looking at TDD,
`BDD <http://blog.dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/>`__,
`unittest <http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html>`__,
`nose <http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/>`__,
`freshen <https://github.com/rlisagor/freshen>`__\ and
`lettuce <http://packages.python.org/lettuce/tutorial/simple.html>`__. 
BDD is TDD with a little different syntax aiming to make building the
tests more natural.  Freshen and lettuce were inspired by a Rails
project call `Cucumber <http://cukes.info/>`__, which has some good
documents on how BDD works.

We discussed the possibility of starting a lunch meet-up to sharpen our
skills by building a fun project.  From the topics of the night Jeff
suggested creating Conway's Game of Life and have it tweet updates. 
Please chime in on the email list if you are interested or have
suggestions.

A few of the projects discussed were:

-  how to create a lot of tweets and schedule them to be sent at certain
   times or intervals.
-  how to sync Facebook and Twitter updates
-  `cURL <http://curl.haxx.se/>`__- command line tool to transfer data
   with url syntax

I failed to take notes so please add to the comments for what I forgot!
