Much of this meeting was spent getting to know Eric, who recently moved
to Omaha, and is an enthusiastic Python'er.  Discussion revolved around
Eric's database generator project and my flashcard website, so a lot of
Django tips, and some internationalization was discussed.  We ended up
at Buffalo Wings and Rings again for some drinks and nachos - maybe this
is becoming a tradition...
