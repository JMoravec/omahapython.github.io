We had a good discussion on ways to build web applications using
Python.Â  Most of the talk was on how
`django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`__\ handles different aspects,
but also included `cherrypy <http://www.cherrypy.org/>`__,
`turbogears <http://turbogears.org/>`__,
`mod\_wsgi <http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/>`__, and `google closure
tools <http://code.google.com/closure/>`__.

The Python Package Index, `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__, which
now has 10,290 packages was lauded a bit, along with the easy\_install
method of adding packages with dependancies easily.
`Virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`__\ was also
mentioned as a way to build isolated Python environments on one machine.

The question: *How to distribute Python programs?* was brought up, and
`py2exe <http://www.py2exe.org/>`__\ was mentioned, but none of the
attendees had much else to say. Please comment if you have another idea.
