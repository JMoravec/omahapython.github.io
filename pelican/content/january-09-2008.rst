We met at Rosken's Hall on UNO's campus courtesy of Burch. Thanks Burch!

This month's meeting was a bit shorter than before due in fact to the
great accommodations. It's amazing how much nicer it is to meet in a
less crowded environment.

Topics:

-  `Crunchy and/or Idiomatic
   Python <http://www.omahapython.org/IdiomaticPython.html>`__
-  Lightning Talks
-  Group Q and A session

   -  `Crunchy <http://crunchy.sourceforge.net/>`__
   -  `SAGE
      math <http://norfolk.cs.washington.edu/htbin-post/unrestricted/colloq/details.cgi?id=574>`__
   -  `Security, Python, Coverity,
      DHS <http://scan.coverity.com/rung2.html>`__
   -  `UtilityMill <http://utilitymill.com/>`__
   -  `func <https://hosted.fedoraproject.org/func/>`__
   -  `gnuCash <http://www.gnucash.org/>`__

The talk generated some nice discussion.

Thanks to everyone who attended.

| Refreshments:
| The venue does not allow food/drink so after the meeting we decided to
  meet at a local establishment for some food and beverage and more
  talk.

| Door Prize:
| Rapid Web Applications withÂ TurboGears, Mark Ramm
