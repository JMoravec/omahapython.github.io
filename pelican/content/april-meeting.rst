Let's get this Python party restarted!

| Details
| The room is open for all attendees at 5:45.

5:45-6:00 Network and get settled in.

6:00-6:10 Opening welcome!

6:10-6:20 Naomi See will provide a lightning talk on why Python and what
Python has done for her community engagement and career.

6:20-6:50 The discussion will open up with the organizer's intentions
behind starting this group back up and letting the attendee's share what
they would like to see this group shape into. Let's work together to
make this awesome for all skillsets.

officially end at 7 but the room is booked until 7:30 if conversations
arise by all means don't let the end of the meeting stop you!
