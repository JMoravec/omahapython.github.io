**Location** - Gordmans Office Building in Aksarben thanks to Aaron
Keck.

Meeting starts at **6pm, Wednesday, 1/21/15**

**Parking and entry details:**

The building is the northwest corner of 67th and Frances and the
Gordmans entrance is next to the “g” sign, about midway along the East
side of the building. There’s parking directly out front, but it
sometimes fills up in the evenings. The garage around back is open to
the public after 5:30 or 6 as well.

The building doors lock at 5, so Aaron will be standing by to badge
people in starting around 5:45. If you’re running late, or early, just
shoot him or the list an email.
