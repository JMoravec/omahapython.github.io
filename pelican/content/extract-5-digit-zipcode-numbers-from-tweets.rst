i am new to python. i have a data of thousand tweets which contain 5
digit zipcode numbers and also other meaningless numbers within the
tweet. these tweets are associated with latitude and longitude
information. i need to extract 5 digit ZIPCode numbers (and ignore other
numbers that are not 5 digit) from those tweets. then make 3 columns for
lat/long /zipcodes. can you please help me with that? Thanks Subrina
