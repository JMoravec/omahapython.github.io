Small turnout but good discussion.  Sean told me about `Portable
Python: <http://www.portablepython.com/>`__

    a Python® programming language preconfigured to run directly from
    any USB storage device, enabling you to have, at any time, a
    portable programming environment. Just download it, extract to your
    portable storage device or hard drive and in 10 minutes you are
    ready to create your next Python® application.

I wonder if it will run from Dropbox? Currently available with Python
2.5.4, 2.6.1, 3.0.1.

I did not take notes, but do remember also talking about CMS's, and
`django CMS <http://www.django-cms.org/en/>`__.  It is at version 2 and
in active development.

Just a reminder to use the `mailing
list <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/omaha>`__ for
questions/comments/interesting Python news.
