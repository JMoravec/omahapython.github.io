Location - a conference room at Gordmans in Aksarben thanks to Aaron
Keck.

Meeting starts at 7pm, Wednesday, 9/17/14

Parking and entry details:

The building is the northwest corner of 67th and Frances and the
Gordmans entrance is next to the “g” sign, about midway along the
building. There’s parking directly out front, but it sometimes fills up
in the evenings. The garage around back is open to the public after 5:30
or 6 as well.

The building doors lock at 5, so Aaron will be standing by to badge
people in starting around 6:45. If you’re running late, or early, just
shoot him an email.
