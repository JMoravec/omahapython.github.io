This month's meeting notes:
===========================

Meeting/Talk Topics:

-  CherryPy and Adobe Flex (Jeff Hinrichs) - Jeff showed a standard
   `CherryPy <http://www.cherrypy.org/>`__ +
   `Cheetah <http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/>`__ application that he
   used as a base and then how he integrated `Adobe
   Flex <http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/>`__ for a spiffed up
   interface. A code walk through was given featuring the
   `MXML <http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/paradigm.html>`__
   used and the `Flex Builder for Linux
   alpha <http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/flexbuilder_linux/>`__
-  Wing IDE (Charles Kaminski) - Charles had a great presentation on the
   `Wing IDE <http://www.wingware.com/>`__ Charles ran a completely live
   presentation showing code intelligence, debugging and lots of other
   goodies that Wing has to offer Python programmers. It was such a good
   presentation that I am seriously considering buying it.
-  A number of people attending retold their stories of their first
   exposure to Python and how they get to use Python at work.

It was a great meeting. Charles brought up the idea of possibly finding
a mid-town watering hole and having the meetings in a back room. So if
anyone knows of a place that supports both libations and presentations
in the mid-town area please let us know.

   Compiler <http://shed-skin.blogspot.com/>`__
