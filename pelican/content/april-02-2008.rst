-  BeautifulSoup by Eli Criffield
-  Tkinter and PMW by Chad Homan

Eli gave a great presentation on the basics
of \ `BeautifulSoup <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`__
and used his \ `sipie <http://sourceforge.net/projects/sipie>`__ project
and \ `ipython <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/>`__ to help demonstrate
the power brew which is BeautifulSoup.

Chad gave a presentation about the advantages
of \ `Tkinter <http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter>`__ on platforms with
limited resources. He also demonstrated
Python MegaWidgets - \ `PMW <http://pmw.sourceforge.net/>`__. PMW builds
on Tkinter to provide things like tabs and notebook metaphors to UIs who
use Tkinter.
