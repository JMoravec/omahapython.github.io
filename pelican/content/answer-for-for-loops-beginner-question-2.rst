  Each iteration reassigns the variable a.

  is how Python handles strings, integers, booleans, floats, /whatever
  else.
| Comparator functions can be written to compare object properties. For
  example a custom object book, may have properties book.name and
  book.title
| For speed you could string compare on just the name, or you could do
  both for completeness.
| Objects can be casted to another object for example a number to a
  string. \ *w*
| Reading some pdfs on object oriented programming would help.
