**Tonight's Meeting**:

Joe talked about the 2 semester course he attended at Iowa Western on
Linux Engineering.

Steve talked about `Code Like a
Pythonista <http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html>`__,
by David Goodger.  He thinks it is a great resource.  I agree with him.
(So much I did a presentation on David's material `back in
2008 <http://www.omahapython.org/IdiomaticPython.html>`__).  Steve also
liked the `Python Challenge <http://www.pythonchallenge.com/>`__.  He
has made it though the first 5 or 6 so far and hopes to make it all the
way through.

Joe brought up the fact that `Full Circle
Magazine <http://fullcirclemagazine.org/>`__ - has released two specific
Python issues, `Issue
1 <http://fullcirclemagazine.org/2011/03/05/its-here-the-python-special-edition-01/>`__
and `Issue
2 <http://fullcirclemagazine.org/python-special-edition-2/>`__.

Jeff brought a Code editor that he likes,
`Editra <http://editra.org/>`__.  It is a very nice, rapidly advancing
development environment.  If you are in the market you should take a
look if Komodo or PyCharm are turning your head.

A non-python, learn how to program environment is MIT's
`Scratch <http://scratch.mit.edu/>`__.  Joe likes `Snake Wrangling for
Kids <http://www.briggs.net.nz/log/writing/snake-wrangling-for-kids/>`__.
