Last night was a great discussion on where to get started with python.
Many resources were discussed, some of which I did not know existed.
Items covered ranged from Users Groups to online free books (i.e. Byte
of Python) to commercial books. Online video tutorials where also
mentioned.

From the POV of the slide presentation, it was a great dry run.
Appreciate the input. I will be updating the slides for a future
meeting. At which time they `will be
published <http://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=ddmkrhj_48cjxtjkdz&hl=en>`__.

For a private copy of the slides, send a message to this mail list.
Obviously if there are a lot of requests I will just post them. Keep in
mind, these slides are a draft.

BTW, I would also like to mention that the NECERT breakfast this
Wednesday has been canceled due to a scheduling conflict. So if anyone
was planning, well your schedule is now free.
