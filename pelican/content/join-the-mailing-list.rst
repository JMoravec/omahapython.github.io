|JoinMailingList|\ Updated 3/25/18:

This user group has been established for well over a decade and the form
of communication has primarily been via theÂ \ `mailing
list. <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/omaha>`__

You are more than welcome to join the mailing list to participate in
conversations as well as ask questions of the group who are established
all over the country at this point.

As of March 2018 we also have a
`twitter <https://twitter.com/OmahaPython>`__ account. It is preferred
that active meeting participants join our
`meetup <https://www.meetup.com/Omahas-Python-Users-Group/>`__ group.
Registering for upcoming events is necessary as seating is currently
limited and if we need to accommodate a larger crowd we need to be aware
of this ahead of time.

This site is currently getting updated and we appreciate your patience
during this time. :)
