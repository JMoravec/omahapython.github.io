We had a good meeting last week, topics included TDD, `Uncle Bob's Clean
Code <http://www.cleancoders.com/>`__,
`VirtualEnvWrapper <http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/>`__,
and `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__.

As usual the summer months have taken their toil on attendance, but it
was nice getting to know Mike, and hopefully next month everyone will
have the kids back in school and a little more time to get together.

Until next month, happy summer.
