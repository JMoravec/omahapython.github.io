Results from Surveys discussions -

-  More timely  notifications for the meetings.  A 2week/1week pattern

-  Vary content over the meeting from Beginner to Advanced
-  Win lottery and split proceeds with others interested in Python, then
   they can retire and have time to attend.
-  Noticed lots of Python envy from perl coders.  (Can't we all just get
   along?)

   venue with more pluses -- Looking for ideas and offers.

   Games, CompSci, Hobby, Academic, Mobile, Robotics, Scientific
