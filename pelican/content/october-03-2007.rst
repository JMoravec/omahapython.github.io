The gathering stayed strong again this month with 2 new people joining
in the fray. A presentation on mod\_python, publisher and psp was given
while pizza was eaten. (Funny thing about having good pizza in an Irish
pub<g>)

Talk then went on about using python in sysadmin tasks and then on to
how best to setup some massive home
storage. \ `GlusterFS <http://www.gluster.org/>`__
, \ `ZFS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS>`__
and \ `NFS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_%28protocol%29>`__.

-  We all seem to have a need for terra type storage<g>

A copy of "`The Python
Cookbook <http://books.google.com/books?id=1Shx_VXS6ioC&dq=the+python+cookbook&pg=PP1&ots=BAa07H-hL2&sig=lR6RHV5GHm-w1RCshG5feH0SyWU&prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dthe%2Bpython%2Bcookbook%26sourceid%3Dnavclient-ff%26ie%3DUTF-8%26rlz%3D1B3GGGL_enUS243US243&sa=X&oi=print&ct=title&cad=one-book-with-thumbnail>`__"
was handed out to the winner of the door prize
(Thanks `O'Reilly <http://ug.oreilly.com/>`__)

After the meeting a social hour(s) ensued with wild eyed talk of google
phones and grand central.

We look forward to seeing old friends and new faces at the next meeting.
