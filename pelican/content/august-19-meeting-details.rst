This month's topic is "**Show me your Python workflow**."

**Jeff Hinrichs** is covering a wide breadth of topics (not going deep
into any one of them) and using an open source project to show a real
implementation. His goal is to pick a bug/feature request and work it
from start to finish as part of the presentation.
