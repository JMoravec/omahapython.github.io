We had a small but enthusiastic group last night.  The main topics
discussed were:

-  Version Controls - subversion and mercurial with Google code, and
   some basics on VC's for newbies.
-  Django - Steve introduced a flashcard app, Jeff shared a bit on the
   'render' shortcut, and he has backported it to v1.2 if you are
   interested.  Proper app templating namespace was discussed.
-  PyCharm 2.5 is out with better templating, virtual env, and version
   control tools.
-  ToDoPy - our learning project at `google
   code <http://code.google.com/p/omaha-python/wiki/TodoPy>`__, was
   discussed showing what we had done last month, and what to work on
   this month - adding a Tasks class by sub-classing List, and the
   associated tests to accompany it.

We had a projector and the screen sharing was much better than last
month - thanks Jeff.

Hope to see everyone next month.
